<A NAME="question1"></A><B>QUESTION 1.</B> <I>Whether by the simple contemplation of a cognition,
independently of any previous knowledge and without reasoning from
signs, we are enabled rightly to judge whether that cognition has
been determined by a previous cognition or whether it refers
immediately to its object.</I>

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.213"></A>  Throughout this paper, the term <A HREF="#note1"><I>intuition</I></A><a name="notemark1"></a> will be taken as
signifying a cognition not determined by a previous cognition of
the same object, and therefore so determined by something out of
the consciousness. Let me request the reader to note this.
<I>Intuition</I> here will be nearly the same as "premiss not itself a
conclusion"; the only difference being that premisses and
conclusions are judgments, whereas an intuition may, as far as its
definition states, be any kind of cognition whatever. But just as
a conclusion (good or bad) is determined in the mind of the
reasoner by its premiss, so cognitions not judgments may be
determined by previous cognitions; and a cogni<A NAME="W2.194"></A>tion not so
determined, and therefore determined directly by the
transcendental object, is to be termed an <I>intuition</I>.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.214"></A>  Now, it is plainly one thing to have an intuition and
another to know intuitively that it is an intuition, and the
question is whether these two things, distinguishable in thought,
are, in fact, invariably connected, so that we can always
intuitively distinguish between an intuition and a cognition
determined by another. Every cognition, as something present, is,
of course, an intuition of itself. But the determination of a
cognition by another cognition or by a transcendental object is
not, at least so far as appears obviously at first, a part of the
immediate content of that cognition, although it would appear to
be an element of the action or passion of the transcendental <I>ego</I>,
which is not, perhaps, in consciousness immediately; and yet this
transcendental action or passion may invariably determine a
cognition of itself, so that, in fact, the determination or
non-determination of the cognition by another may be a part of the
cognition. In this case, I should say that we had an intuitive
power of distinguishing an intuition from another cognition.

<P>

      There is no evidence that we have this faculty, except that
we seem to <I>feel</I> that we have it. But the weight of that testimony
depends entirely on our being supposed to have the power of
distinguishing in this feeling whether the feeling be the result
of education, old associations, etc., or whether it is an
intuitive cognition; or, in other words, it depends on
presupposing the very matter testified to. Is this feeling
infallible? And is this judgment concerning it infallible, and so
on, <I>ad infinitum</I>? Supposing that a man really could shut himself
up in such a faith, he would be, of course, impervious to the
truth, "evidence-proof."

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.215"></A>  But let us compare the theory with the historic facts. The
power of intuitively distinguishing intuitions from other
cognitions has not prevented men from disputing very warmly as to
which cognitions are intuitive. In the middle ages, reason and
external authority were regarded as two cordinate sources of
knowledge, just as reason and the authority of intuition are now;
only the happy device of considering the enunciations of authority
to be essentially indemonstrable had not yet been hit upon. All
authorities were not considered as infallible, any more than all
reasons; but when <A HREF="#note2">Berengarius</A><a name="notemark2"></a> said that the authoritativeness of
any particular authority must rest upon reason, the proposition
was scouted as opinionated, impious, and absurd.  Thus, the
credibility of authority was regarded by men of that time
<A NAME="W2.195"></A>simply as an ultimate premiss, as a cognition not determined
by a previous cognition of the same object, or, in our terms, as
an intuition. It is strange that they should have thought so, if,
as the theory now under discussion supposes, by merely
contemplating the credibility of the authority, as a Fakir does
his God, they could have seen that it was not an ultimate premiss!
Now, what if our <I>internal</I> authority should meet the same fate, in
the history of opinions, as that external authority has met? Can
that be said to be absolutely certain which many sane,
well-informed, and thoughtful men already doubt?

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.216"></A>  Every lawyer knows how difficult it is for witnesses to
distinguish between what they have seen and what they have
inferred. This is particularly noticeable in the case of a person
who is describing the performances of a spiritual medium or of a
professed juggler. The difficulty is so great that the juggler
himself is often astonished at the discrepancy between the actual
facts and the statement of an intelligent witness who has not
understood the trick. A part of the very complicated trick of the
Chinese rings consists in taking two solid rings linked together,
talking about them as though they were sepa<A NAME="W2.196"></A>rate -- taking it
for granted, as it were -- then pretending to put them together,
and handing them immediately to the spectator that he may see that
they are solid. The art of this consists in raising, at first, the
strong suspicion that one is broken. I have seen McAlister do this
with such success, that a person sitting close to him, with all
his faculties straining to detect the illusion, would have been
ready to swear that he saw the rings put together, and, perhaps,
if the juggler had not professedly practised deception, would have
considered a doubt of it as a doubt of his own veracity. This
certainly seems to show that it is not always very easy to
distinguish between a premiss and a conclusion, that we have no
infallible power of doing so, and that in fact our only security
in difficult cases is in some signs from which we can infer that a
given fact must have been seen or must have been inferred. In
trying to give an account of a dream, every accurate person must
often have felt that it was a hopeless undertaking to attempt to
disentangle waking interpretations and fillings out from the
fragmentary images of the dream itself.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.217"></A>  The mention of dreams suggests another argument. A dream,
as far as its own content goes, is exactly like an actual
experience. It is mistaken for one. And yet all the world believes
that dreams are determined, according to the laws of the
association of ideas, etc., by previous cognitions. If it be said
that the faculty of intuitively recognizing intuitions is asleep,
I reply that this is a mere supposition, without other support.
Besides, even when we wake up, we do not find that the dream
differed from reality, except by certain <I>marks</I>, darkness and
fragmentariness. Not unfrequently a dream is so vivid that the
memory of it is mistaken for the memory of an actual occurrence.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.218"></A>  A child has, as far as we know, all the perceptive powers
of a man. Yet question him a little as to <I>how</I> he knows what he
does. In many cases, he will tell you that he never learned his
mother-tongue; he always knew it, or he knew it as soon as he came
to have sense. It appears, then, that <I>he</I> does not possess the
faculty of distinguishing, by simple contemplation, between an
intuition and a cognition determined by others.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.219"></A>  There can be no doubt that before the publication of
Berkeley's book on Vision, it had generally been believed that the
third dimension of space was immediately intuited, although, at
present, nearly all admit that it is known by inference. We had
been <I>contemplating</I> <A NAME="W2.197"></A>the object since the very creation of man,
but this discovery was not made until we began to <I>reason</I> about it.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.220"></A>  Does the reader know of the blind spot on the retina? Take
a number of this journal, turn over the cover so as to expose the
white paper, lay it sideways upon the table before which you must
sit, and put two cents upon it, one near the left-hand edge, and
the other to the right. Put your left hand over your left eye, and
with the right eye look <I>steadily</I> at the left-hand cent. Then, with
your right hand, move the right-hand cent (which is now plainly
seen) <I>towards</I> the left hand. When it comes to a place near the
middle of the page it will disappear -- you cannot see it without
turning your eye. Bring it nearer to the other cent, or carry it
further away, and it will reappear; but at that particular spot it
cannot be seen. Thus it appears that there is a blind spot nearly
in the middle of the retina; and this is confirmed by anatomy. It
follows that the space we immediately see (when one eye is closed)
is not, as we had imagined, a continuous oval, but is a ring, the
filling up of which must be the work of the intellect. What more
striking example could be desired of the impossibility of
distinguishing intellectual results from intuitional data, by mere
contemplation?

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.221"></A>  A man can distinguish different textures of cloth by
feeling; but not immediately, for he requires to move his fingers
over the cloth, which shows that he is obliged to compare the
sensations of one instant with those of another.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.222"></A>  The pitch of a tone depends upon the rapidity of the
succession of the vibrations which reach the ear. Each of those
vibrations produces an impulse upon the ear. Let a single such
impulse be made upon the ear, and we know, experimentally, that it
is perceived. There is, therefore, good reason to believe that
each of the impulses forming a tone is perceived. Nor is there any
reason to the contrary. So that this is the only admissible
supposition. Therefore, the pitch of a tone depends upon the
rapidity with which certain impressions are successively conveyed
to the mind. These impressions must exist previously to any tone;
hence, the sensation of pitch is determined by previous
cognitions. Nevertheless, this would never have been discovered by
the mere contemplation of that feeling.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.223"></A>  A similar argument may be urged in reference to the
perception of two dimensions of space. This appears to be an
immediate intuition. But if we were to see immediately an extended
surface, our <A NAME="W2.198"></A>retinas must be spread out in an extended
surface. Instead of that, the retina consists of innumerable
needles pointing towards the light, and whose distances from one
another are decidedly greater than the <I>minimum visibile</I>. Suppose
each of those nerve-points conveys the sensation of a little
colored surface. Still, what we immediately see must even then be,
not a continuous surface, but a collection of spots. Who could
discover this by mere intuition? But all the analogies of the
nervous system are against the supposition that the excitation of
a single nerve can produce an idea as complicated as that of a
space, however small. If the excitation of no one of these nerve
points can immediately convey the impression of space, the
excitation of all cannot do so. For, the excitation of each
produces some impression (according to the analogies of the
nervous system), hence, the sum of these impressions is a
necessary condition of any perception produced by the excitation
of all; or, in other terms, a perception produced by the
excitation of all is determined by the mental impressions produced
by the excitation of every one. This argument is confirmed by the
fact that the existence of the perception of space can be fully
accounted for by the action of faculties known to exist, without
supposing it to be an immediate impression. For this purpose, we
must bear in mind the following facts of physio-psychology: 1. The
excitation of a nerve does not of itself inform us where the
extremity of it is situated. If, by a surgical operation, certain
nerves are displaced, our sensations from those nerves do not
inform us of the displacement. 2. A single sensation does not
inform us how many nerves or nerve-points are excited. 3. We can
distinguish between the impressions produced by the excitations of
different nerve-points. 4. The differences of impressions produced
by different excitations of similar nerve-points are similar. Let
a momentary image be made upon the retina. By No. 2, the
impression thereby produced will be indistinguishable from what
might be produced by the excitation of some conceivable single
nerve. It is not conceivable that the momentary excitation of a
single nerve should give the sensation of space. Therefore, the
momentary excitation of all the nerve-points of the retina cannot,
immediately or mediately, produce the sensation of space. The same
argument would apply to any unchanging image on the retina.
Suppose, however, that the image moves over the retina. Then the
peculiar excitation which at one instant affects one nerve-point,
at a later instant will affect another. These will convey
impressions which are very similar by 4, and yet which are
<A NAME="W2.199"></A>distinguishable by 3. Hence, the conditions for the
recognition of a relation between these impressions are present.
There being, however, a very great number of nerve-points affected
by a very great number of successive excitations, the relations of
the resulting impressions will be almost inconceivably
complicated. Now, it is a known law of mind, that when phenomena
of an extreme complexity are presented, which yet would be reduced
to <I>order</I> or mediate simplicity by the application of a certain
conception, that conception sooner or later arises in application
to those phenomena. In the case under consideration, the
conception of extension would reduce the phenomena to unity, and,
therefore, its genesis is fully accounted for. It remains only to
explain why the previous cognitions which determine it are not
more clearly apprehended. For this explanation, I shall refer to a
<A HREF="#note3">paper</A><a name="notemark3"></a> upon a new list of categories, Section 5, merely adding
that just as we are able to recognize our friends by certain
appearances, although we cannot possibly say what those
appearances are and are quite unconscious of any process of
reasoning, so in any case when the reasoning is easy and natural
to us, however complex may be the premisses, they sink into
insignificance and oblivion proportionately to the
satisfactoriness of the theory based upon them. This theory of
space is confirmed by the circumstance that an exactly similar
theory is imperatively demanded by the facts in reference to time.
That the course of time should be immediately felt is obviously
impossible. For, in that case, there must be an element of this
feeling at each instant. But in an instant there is no duration
and hence no immediate feeling of duration. Hence, no one of these
elementary feelings is an immediate feeling of duration; and,
hence the sum of all is not. On the other hand, the impressions of
any moment are very complicated -- containing all the images (or
the elements of the images) of sense and memory, which complexity
is reducible to mediate simplicity by means of the conception of
time.<A HREF="#note4">***</A><a name="notemark4"></a> 

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.224"></A>  <A NAME="W2.200"></A>We have, therefore, a variety of facts, all of which
are most readily explained on the supposition that we have no
intuitive faculty of distinguishing intuitive from mediate
cognitions. Some arbitrary hypothesis may otherwise explain any
one of these facts; this is the only theory which brings them to
support one another. Moreover, no facts require the supposition of
the faculty in question. Whoever has studied the nature of proof
will see, then, that there are here very strong reasons for
disbelieving the existence of this faculty. These will become
still stronger when the consequences of rejecting it have, in this
paper and in a following one, been more fully traced out.

<P>


<a name="question2"></A><B>QUESTION 2.</B> <I>Whether we have an intuitive self-consciousness.</I>

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.225"></A>  Self-consciousness, as the term is here used, is to be
distinguished both from consciousness generally, from the internal
sense, and from pure apperception. Any cognition is a
consciousness of the object as represented; by self-consciousness
is meant a knowledge of our<A NAME="W2.201"></A>selves. Not a mere feeling of
subjective conditions of consciousness, but of our personal
selves. Pure apperception is the self-assertion of THE <I>ego</I>; the
self-consciousness here meant is the recognition of my <I>private</I>
self. I know that <I>I</I> (not merely <I>the</I> I) exist. The question is, how
do I know it; by a special intuitive faculty, or is it determined
by previous cognitions?

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.226"></A>  Now, it is not self-evident that we have such an intuitive
faculty, for it has just been shown that we have no intuitive
power of distinguishing an intuition from a cognition determined
by others. Therefore, the existence or non-existence of this power
is to be determined upon evidence, and the question is whether
self-consciousness can be explained by the action of known
faculties under conditions known to exist, or whether it is
necessary to suppose an unknown cause for this cognition, and, in
the latter case, whether an intuitive faculty of
self-consciousness is the most probable cause which can be
supposed.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.227"></A>  It is first to be observed that there is no known
self-consciousness to be accounted for in extremely young
children. It has already been pointed out by <A HREF="#note5">Kant</A><a name="notemark5"></a> that the late
use of the very common word "I" with children indicates an
imperfect self-consciousness in them, and that, therefore, so far
as it is admissible for us to draw any conclusion in regard to the
mental state of those who are still younger, it must be against
the existence of any self-consciousness in them.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.228"></A>  On the other hand, children manifest powers of thought much
earlier. Indeed, it is almost impossible to assign a period at
which children do not already exhibit decided intellectual
activity in directions in which thought is indispensable to their
well-being. The complicated trigonometry of vision, and the
delicate adjustments of coordinated movement, are plainly mastered
very early. There is no reason to question a similar degree of
thought in reference to themselves.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.229"></A>  A very young child may always be observed to watch its own
body with great attention. There is every reason why this should
be so, for from the child's point of view this body is the most
important thing in the universe. Only what it touches has any
actual and present feeling; only what it faces has any actual
color; only what is on its tongue has any actual taste.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.230"></A>  No one questions that, when a sound is heard by a child, he
thinks, not of himself as hearing, but of the bell or other object
as sounding. <A NAME="W2.202"></A>How when he wills to move a table? Does he then
think of himself as desiring, or only of the table as fit to be
moved? That he has the latter thought, is beyond question; that he
has the former, must, until the existence of an intuitive
self-consciousness is proved, remain an arbitrary and baseless
supposition. There is no good reason for thinking that he is less
ignorant of his own peculiar condition than the angry adult who
denies that he is in a passion.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.231"></A>  The child, however, must soon discover by observation that
things which are thus fit to be changed are apt actually to
undergo this change, after a contact with that peculiarly
important body called Willy or Johnny. This consideration makes
this body still more important and central, since it establishes a
connection between the fitness of a thing to be changed and a
tendency in this body to touch it before it is changed.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.232"></A>  The child learns to understand the language; that is to
say, a connection between certain sounds and certain facts becomes
established in his mind. He has previously noticed the connection
between these sounds and the motions of the lips of bodies
somewhat similar to the central one, and has tried the experiment
of putting his hand on those lips and has found the sound in that
case to be smothered. He thus connects that language with bodies
somewhat similar to the central one. By efforts, so unenergetic
that they should be called rather instinctive, perhaps, than
tentative, he learns to produce those sounds. So he begins to
converse.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.233"></A>  It must be about this time that he begins to find that what
these people about him say is the very best evidence of fact. So
much so, that testimony is even a stronger mark of fact than <I>the
facts themselves</I>, or rather than what must now be thought of as
the <I>appearances</I> themselves. (I may remark, by the way, that this
remains so through life; testimony will convince a man that he
himself is mad.) A child hears it said that the stove is hot. But
it is not, he says; and, indeed, that central body is not touching
it, and only what that touches is hot or cold. But he touches it,
and finds the testimony confirmed in a striking way. Thus, he
becomes aware of ignorance, and it is necessary to suppose a <I>self</I>
in which this ignorance can inhere. So testimony gives the first
dawning of self-consciousness.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.234"></A>  But, further, although usually appearances are either only
confirmed or merely supplemented by testimony, yet there is a
certain remarkable class of appearances which are continually con-
<A NAME="W2.203"></A>tradicted by testimony. These are those predicates which <I>we</I>
know to be emotional, but which <I>he</I> distinguishes by their
connection with the movements of that central person, himself
(that the table wants moving, etc.) These judgments are generally
denied by others. Moreover, he has reason to think that others,
also, have such judgments which are quite denied by all the rest.
Thus, he adds to the conception of appearance as the actualization
of fact, the conception of it as something <I>private</I> and valid only
for one body. In short, <I>error</I> appears, and it can be explained
only by supposing a <I>self</I> which is fallible.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.235"></A>  Ignorance and error are all that distinguish our private
selves from the absolute <I>ego</I> of pure apperception.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.236"></A>  Now, the theory which, for the sake of perspicuity, has
thus been stated in a specific form, may be summed up as follows:
At the age at which we know children to be self-conscious, we know
that they have been made aware of ignorance and error; and we know
them to possess at that age powers of understanding sufficient to
enable them to infer from ignorance and error their own existence.
Thus we find that known faculties, acting under conditions known
to exist, would rise to self-consciousness. The only essential
defect in this account of the matter is, that while we know that
children exercise <I>as much</I> understanding as is here supposed, we do
not know that they exercise it in precisely this way. Still the
supposition that they do so is infinitely more supported by facts,
than the supposition of a wholly peculiar faculty of the mind.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.237"></A>  The only argument worth noticing for the existence of an
intuitive self-consciousness is this. We are more certain of our
own existence than of any other fact; a premiss cannot determine a
conclusion to be more certain than it is itself; hence, our own
existence cannot have been inferred from any other fact. The first
premiss must be admitted, but the second premiss is founded on an
exploded theory of logic. A conclusion cannot be more certain than
that some one of the facts which support it is true, but it may
easily be more certain than any one of those facts. Let us
suppose, for example, that a dozen witnesses testify to an
occurrence. Then my belief in that occurrence rests on the belief
that each of those men is generally to be believed upon oath. Yet
the fact testified to is made more certain than that any one of
those men is generally to be believed. In the same way, to the
developed mind of man, his own existence is sup<A NAME="W2.204"></A>ported by
<I>every other fact</I>, and is, therefore, incomparably more certain
than any one of these facts. But it cannot be said to be more
certain than that there is another fact, since there is no doubt
perceptible in either case.

<P>

      It is to be concluded, then, that there is no necessity of
supposing an intuitive self-consciousness, since
self-consciousness may easily be the result of inference.

<P>


<a name="question3"></A><B>QUESTION 3.</B> <I>Whether we have an intuitive power of
distinguishing between the subjective elements of different kinds
of cognitions.</I>

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.238"></A>  Every cognition involves something represented, or that of
which we are conscious, and some action or passion of the self
whereby it becomes represented. The former shall be termed the
objective, the latter the subjective, element of the cognition.
The cognition itself is an intuition of its objective element,
which may therefore be called, also, the immediate object. The
subjective element is not necessarily immediately known, but it is
possible that such an intuition of the subjective element of a
cognition of its character, whether that of dreaming, imagining,
conceiving, believing, etc., should accompany every cognition. The
question is whether this is so.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.239"></A>  It would appear, at first sight, that there is an
overwhelming array of evidence in favor of the existence of such a
power. The difference between seeing a color and imagining it is
immense. There is a vast difference between the most vivid dream
and reality. And if we had no intuitive power of distinguishing
between what we believe and what we merely conceive, we never, it
would seem, could in any way distinguish them; since if we did so
by reasoning, the question would arise whether the argument itself
was believed or conceived, and this must be answered before the
conclusion could have any force. And thus there would be a
<I>regressus ad infinitum</I>. Besides, if we do not know that we
believe, then, from the nature of the case, we do not believe.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.240"></A>  But be it noted that we do not intuitively know the
existence of this faculty. For it is an intuitive one, and we
cannot intuitively know that a cognition is intuitive. The
question is, therefore, whether it is necessary to suppose the
existence of this faculty, or whether then the facts can be
explained without this supposition.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.241"></A>  In the first place, then, the difference between what is
imagined or dreamed and what is actually experienced, is no
argument in favor of the existence of such a faculty. For it is
not questioned that there are distinctions <A NAME="W2.205"></A>in what is present
to the mind, but the question is, whether independently of any
such distinctions in the immediate <I>objects</I> of consciousness, we
have any immediate power of distinguishing different modes of
consciousness. Now, the very fact of the immense difference in the
immediate objects of sense and imagination, sufficiently accounts
for our distinguishing those faculties; and instead of being an
argument in favor of the existence of an intuitive power of
distinguishing the subjective elements of consciousness, it is a
powerful reply to any such argument, so far as the distinction of
sense and imagination is concerned.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.242"></A>  Passing to the distinction of belief and conception, we
meet the statement that the knowledge of belief is essential to
its existence. Now, we can unquestionably distinguish a belief
from a conception, in most cases, by means of a peculiar feeling
of conviction; and it is a mere question of words whether we
define belief as that judgment which is accompanied by this
feeling, or as that judgment from which a man will act. We may
conveniently call the former <I>sensational</I>, the latter <I>active</I>,
belief. That neither of these necessarily involves the other, will
surely be admitted without any recital of facts. Taking belief in
the sensational sense, the intuitive power of reorganizing it will
amount simply to the capacity for the sensation which accompanies
the judgment. This sensation, like any other, is an object of
consciousness; and therefore the capacity for it implies no
intuitive recognition of subjective elements of consciousness. If
belief is taken in the active sense, it may be discovered by the
observation of external facts and by inference from the sensation
of conviction which usually accompanies it.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.243"></A>  Thus, the arguments in favor of this peculiar power of
consciousness disappear, and the presumption is again against such
a hypothesis. Moreover, as the immediate objects of any two
faculties must be admitted to be different, the facts do not
render such a supposition in any degree necessary.

<P>


<a name="question4"></A><B>QUESTION 4.</B> <I>Whether we have any power of introspection, or whether
our whole knowledge of the internal world is derived from the
observation of external facts.</I>

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.244"></A>  It is not intended here to assume the reality of the
external world. Only, there is a certain set of facts which are
ordinarily regarded as external, while others are regarded as
internal. The question is whether the latter are known otherwise
than by inference from the <A NAME="W2.206"></A>former. By introspection, I mean a
direct perception of the internal world, but not necessarily a
perception of it <I>as</I> internal. Nor do I mean to limit the
signification of the word to intuition, but would extend it to any
knowledge of the internal world not derived from external
observation.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.245"></A>. There is one sense in which any perception has an internal
object, namely, that every sensation is partly determined by
internal conditions. Thus, the sensation of redness is as it is,
owing to the constitution of the mind; and in this sense it is a
sensation of something internal. Hence, we may derive a knowledge
of the mind from a consideration of this sensation, but that
knowledge would, in fact, be an inference from redness as a
predicate of something external. On the other hand, there are
certain other feelings -- the emotions, for example -- which
appear to arise in the first place, not as predicates at all, and
to be referable to the mind alone. It would seem, then, that by
means of these, a knowledge of the mind may be obtained, which is
not inferred from any character of outward things. The question is
whether this is really so.

<A NAME="CP5.246"></A>. Although introspection is not necessarily intuitive, it is
not self-evident that we possess this capacity; for we have no
intuitive faculty of distinguishing different subjective modes of
consciousness. The power, if it exists, must be known by the
circumstance that the facts cannot be explained without it.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.247"></A>  In reference to the above argument from the emotions, it
must be admitted that if a man is angry, his anger implies, in
general, no determinate and constant character in its object. But,
on the other hand, it can hardly be questioned that there is some
relative character in the outward thing which makes him angry, and
a little reflection will serve to show that his anger consists in
his saying to himself, "this thing is vile, abominable, etc." and
that it is rather a mark of returning reason to say, "I am angry."
In the same way any emotion is a predication concerning some
object, and the chief difference between this and an objective
intellectual judgment is that while the latter is relative to
human nature or to mind in general, the former is relative to the
particular circumstances and disposition of a particular man at a
particular time. What is here said of emotions in general, is true
in particular of the sense of beauty and of the moral sense. Good
and bad are feelings which first arise as predicates, and
therefore are either predicates of the not-I, or are determined by
previous <A NAME="W2.207"></A>cognitions (there being no intuitive power of
distinguishing subjective elements of consciousness).

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.248"></A>  It remains, then, only to inquire whether it is necessary
to suppose a particular power of introspection for the sake of
accounting for the sense of willing. Now, volition, as
distinguished from desire, is nothing but the power of
concentrating the attention, of abstracting. Hence, the knowledge
of the power of abstracting may be inferred from abstract objects,
just as the knowledge of the power of seeing is inferred from
colored objects.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.249"></A>  It appears, there<A NAME="W2.208"></A>fore, that there is no reason for
supposing a power of introspection; and, consequently, the only
way of investigating a psychological question is by inference from
external facts.

<P>


<a name="question5"></A><B>QUESTION 5.</B> <I>Whether we can think without signs.</I>

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.250"></A>  This is a familiar question, but there is, to this day, no
better argument in the affirmative than that thought must precede
every sign. This assumes the impossibility of an infinite series.
But Achilles, as a fact, will overtake the tortoise. <I>How</I> this
happens, is a question not necessary to be answered at present, as
long as it certainly does happen.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.251"></A>. If we seek the light of external facts, the only cases of
thought which we can find are of thought in signs. Plainly, no
other thought can be evidenced by external facts. But we have seen
that only by external facts can thought be known at all. The only
thought, then, which can possibly be cognized is thought in signs.
But thought which cannot be cognized does not exist. All thought,
therefore, must necessarily be in signs.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.252"></A>  A man says to himself, "Aristotle is a man; <I>therefore</I>, he
is fallible." Has he not, then, thought what he has not said to
himself, that all men are fallible? The answer is, that he has
done so, so far as this is said in his <I>therefore</I>. According to
this, our question does not relate to <I>fact</I>, but is a mere asking
for distinctness of thought.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.253"></A>  From the proposition that every thought is a sign, it
follows that every thought must address itself to some other, must
determine some other, since that is the essence of a sign. This,
after all, is but another form of the familiar axiom, that in
intuition, i.e., in the immediate present, there is no thought,
or, that all which is reflected upon has past. <I>Hinc loquor inde
est.</I> That, since any thought, there must have been a thought, has
its analogue in the fact that, since any past time, there must
have been an infinite series of times. To say, therefore, that
thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is but
another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in
another, or that all thought is in signs.

<P>


<a name="question6"></A><B>QUESTION 6.</B> <I>Whether a sign can have any meaning, if by its
definition it is the sign of something absolutely incognizable.</I>

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.254"></A>  It would seem that it can, and that universal and
hypothetical propositions are instances of it. Thus, the universal
proposition, "all ruminants are cloven-hoofed," speaks of a
possible infinity of animals, and no matter how many ruminants may
have been examined, the possibility must remain that there are
others which have not been examined. In the case of a hypothetical
proposition, the same thing is still more manifest; for such a
proposition speaks not merely of the actual state of things, but
of every possible state of things, all of which are not knowable,
inasmuch as only one can so much as exist.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.255"></A>  On the other hand, all our conceptions are obtained by
abstractions and combinations of cognitions first occurring in
judgments of experience. Accordingly, there can be no conception
of the absolutely incognizable, since nothing of that sort occurs
in experience. But the meaning of a term is the conception which
it conveys. Hence, a term can have no such meaning.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.256"></A>  If it be said that the incognizable is a concept compounded
of the concept <I>not</I> and <I>cognizable</I>, it may be replied that <I>not</I> is a
mere syncategorematic term and not a concept by itself.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.257"></A>  If I think "white," I will not go so far as Berkeley and
say that I think of a person seeing, but I will say that what I
think is of the nature of a cognition, and so of anything else
which can be experienced. Consequently, the highest concept which
can be reached by abstractions from judgments of experience -- and
therefore, the highest concept which can be reached at all -- is
the concept of something of the nature of a cognition. <I>Not</I>, then,
or <I>what is other than</I>, if a concept, is a concept of the
cognizable. Hence, not-cognizable, if a concept, is a concept of
the form "A, not-A," and is, at least, self-contradictory. Thus,
ignorance and error can only be conceived as correlative to a real
knowledge and truth, which latter are of the nature of cognitions.
Over against any cognition, there is an unknown but knowable
reality; but over against all possible cognition, there is only
the self-contradictory. In short, <I>cognizability</I> (in its widest
sense) and <I>being</I> are not merely metaphysically the same, but are
synonymous terms.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.258"></A>  To the argument from universal and hypothetical
propositions, <A NAME="W2.209"></A>the reply is, that though their truth cannot be
cognized with absolute certainty, it may be probably known by
induction.

<P>


<a name="question7"></A><B>QUESTION 7.</B> <I>Whether there is any cognition not determined by
a previous cognition.</I>

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.259"></A>  It would seem that there is or has been; for since we are
in possession of cognitions, which are all determined by previous
ones, and these by cognitions earlier still, there must have been
a <I>first</I> in this series or else our state of cognition at any time
is completely determined, according to logical laws, by our state
at any previous time. But there are many facts against the last
supposition, and therefore in favor of intuitive cognitions.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.260"></A>  On the other hand, since it is impossible to know
intuitively that a given cognition is not determined by a previous
one, the only way in which this can be known is by hypothetic
inference from observed facts. But to adduce the cognition by
which a given cognition has been determined is to explain the
determinations of that cognition. And it is the only way of
explaining them. For something entirely out of consciousness which
may be supposed to determine it, can, as such, only be known and
only adduced in the determinate cognition in question. So, that to
suppose that a cognition is determined solely by something
absolutely external, is to suppose its determinations incapable of
explanation. Now, this is a hypothesis which is warranted under no
circumstances, inasmuch as the only possible justification for a
hypothesis is that it explains the facts, and to say that they are
explained and at the same time to suppose them inexplicable is
self-contradictory.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.261"></A>  If it be objected that the peculiar character of <I>red</I> is not
determined by any previous cognition, I reply that that character
is not a character of red as a cognition; for if there be a man to
whom red things look as blue ones do to me and <I>vice versa</I>, that
man's eyes teach him the same facts that they would if he were
like me.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.262"></A>  Moreover, we know of no power by which an intuition could
be known. For, as the cognition is beginning, and therefore in a
state of change, at only the first instant would it be intuition.
And, therefore, the apprehension of it must take place in no time
and be an event occupying no time.<A HREF="#note6">***</A><a name="notemark6"></a> Besides, all the cognitive
faculties we know of are relative, and consequently their products
are relations. But the <A NAME="W2.210"></A>cognition of a relation is determined
by previous cognitions. No cognition not determined by a previous
cognition, then, can be known. It does not exist, then, first,
because it is absolutely incognizable, and second, because a
cognition only exists so far as it is known.

<P>

<A NAME="CP5.263"></A>  The reply to the argument that there must be a first is as
follows: In retracing our way from conclusions to premisses, or
from determined cognitions to those which determine them, we
finally reach, in all cases, a point beyond which the
consciousness in the determined cognition is more lively than in
the cognition which determines it. We have a less lively
consciousness in the cognition which determines our cognition of
the third dimension than in the latter cognition itself; a less
lively consciousness in the cognition which determines our
cognition of a continuous surface (without a blind spot) than in
this latter cognition itself; and a less lively consciousness of
the impressions which determine the sensation of tone than of that
sensation itself. Indeed, when we get near enough to the external
this is the universal rule. Now let any horizontal line represent
a cognition, and let the length of the line serve to measure (so
to speak) the liveliness of consciousness in that cognition. A
point, having no length, will, on this principle, represent an
object quite out of consciousness. Let one horizontal line below
another represent a cognition which determines the cognition
represented by that other and which has the same object as the
latter. Let the finite distance between two such lines represent
that they are two different cognitions. With this aid to thinking,
let us see whether "there must be a first." Suppose an inverted
triangle  to be gradually dipped into water. At any date or
instant, the surface of the water makes a horizontal line across
that triangle. This line represents a cognition. At a subsequent
date, there is a sectional line so made, higher upon the triangle.
This represents another cognition of the same object determined by
the former, and having a livelier consciousness. The apex of the
triangle represents the object external to the mind which
determines both these cognitions. The state of the triangle before
it reaches the water, represents a state of cognition which
contains nothing which determines these subsequent cognitions. To
say, then, that if there be a state of cognition by which all
subsequent cognitions of a certain object are not determined,
there must subsequently be some cognition of that object not
determined by previous cognitions of the same object, is to say
that when that triangle is dipped into the water there must be a
sectional line made by the surface of the water lower than which
no surface line had been made in that <A NAME="W2.211"></A>way. But draw the
horizontal line where you will, as many horizontal lines as you
please can be assigned at finite distances below it and below one
another. For any such section is at some distance above the apex,
otherwise it is not a line. Let this distance be <I>a</I>. Then there
have been similar sections at the distances 1/2<I>a</I>, 1/4<I>a</I>, 1/8<I>a</I>,
1/16<I>a</I>, above the apex, and so on as far as you please. So that it
is not true that there must be a first. Explicate the logical
difficulties of this paradox (they are identical with those of the
Achilles) in whatever way you may. I am content with the result,
as long as your principles are fully applied to the particular
case of cognitions determining one another. Deny motion, if it
seems proper to do so; only then deny the process of determination
of one cognition by another. Say that instants and lines are
fictions; only say, also, that states of cognition and judgments
are fictions. The point here insisted on is not this or that
logical solution of the difficulty, but merely that cognition
arises by a <I>process</I> of beginning, as any other change comes to
pass.

<P>

      In a subsequent paper, I shall trace the consequences of
these principles, in reference to the questions of reality, of
individuality, and of the validity of the laws of logic.

<a name="note1">1.</a>  The word <I>intuitus</I> first occurs as a technical term in
St. Anselm's <CITE>Monologium</CITE>. [<CITE>Monologium</CITE>, LXVI; Cf. Prantl, III, S.
332, 746n.] He wished to distinguish between our knowledge of God
and our knowledge of finite things (and in the next world, of God,
also); and thinking of the saying of St. Paul, <I>Videmus nunc per
speculum in aenigmate: tunc autem facie ad faciem</I>, [LXX], he called
the former <I>speculation</I> and the latter <I>intuition</I>. This use of
"speculation" did not take root, because that word already had
another exact and widely different meaning. In the middle ages,
the term "intuitive cognition" had two principal senses; 1st, as
opposed to abstractive cognition, it meant the knowledge of the
present as present, and this is its meaning in Anselm; but 2d, as
no intuitive cognition was allowed to be determined by a previous
cognition, it came to be used as the opposite of discursive
cognition (see Scotus, <CITE>In sentent.</CITE>, lib. 2, dist. 3, qu. 9), and
this is nearly the sense in which I employ it. This is also nearly
the sense in which Kant uses it, the former distinction being
expressed by his <I>sensuous</I> and <I>non-sensuous</I>. (See <CITE>Werke</CITE>, herausg.
Rosenkranz, Thl. 2, S. 713, 31, 41, 100, u.s.w.) An enumeration of
six meanings of intuition may be found in Hamilton's <CITE>Reid</CITE>, p. 759.

<a name="note2">2.</a> The proposition of Berengarius is contained in the
following quotation from his <CITE>De Sacra Coena</CITE>: "<I>Maximi plane cordis
est, per omnia ad dialecticam confugere, quia confugere ad eam ad
rationem est confugere, quo qui non confugit, cum secundum
rationem sit factus ad imaginem dei, suum honorem reliquit, nec
potest renovari de die in diem ad imaginem dei.</I>" The most striking
characteristic of medieval reasoning, in general, is the perpetual
resort to authority. When Fredigisus and others wish to prove that
darkness is a thing, although they have evidently derived the
opinion from nominalistic-Platonistic meditations, they argue the
matter thus: "God called the darkness, night;" then, certainly, it
is a thing, for otherwise before it had a name, there would have
been nothing, not even a fiction to name. [See Prantl, II, 19f.]
Abelard [<CITE>Ouvrages</CITE>, p. 179] thinks it worth while to cite Boethius,
when he says that space has three dimensions, and when he says
that an individual cannot be in two places at once. The author of
<CITE>De Generibus et Speciebus</CITE> [ibid., p. 517], a work of a superior
order, in arguing against a Platonic doctrine, says that if
whatever is universal is eternal, the <I>form</I> and matter of Socrates,
being severally universal, are both eternal, and that, therefore,
Socrates was not created by God, but only put together, "<I>quod
quantum a vero deviet, palam est.</I>" The authority is the final
court of appeal. The same author, where in one place he doubts a
statement of Boethius [ibid., p. 535f], finds it necessary to
assign a special reason why in this case it is not absurd to do
so. <I>Exceptio probat regulam in casibus non exceptis.</I> Recognized
authorities were certainly sometimes disputed in the twelfth
century; their mutual contradictions insured that; and the
authority of philosophers was regarded as inferior to that of
theologians. Still, it would be impossible to find a passage where
the authority of Aristotle is directly denied upon any logical
question. "<I>Sunt et multi errores eius</I>," says John of Salisbury
[<CITE>Metalogicon</CITE>, Lib. IV, cap. XXVIII], "<I>qui in scripturis tam
ethnicis, quam fidelibus poterunt inveniri; verum in logica parem
habuisse non legitur</I>." "<I>Sed nihil adversus Aristotelem</I>," says
Abelard, and in another place, "<I>Sed si Aristotelem Peripateticorum
principem culpare possumus, quam amplius in hacarte recepimus?</I>"
The idea of going without an authority, or of subordinating
authority to reason, does not occur to him.

<a name="note4">4.</a> The above theory of space and time does not conflict
with that of Kant so much as it appears to do. They are in fact
the solutions of different questions. Kant, it is true, makes
space and time intuitions, or rather forms of intuition, but it is
not essential to his theory that intuition should mean more than
"individual representation." The apprehension of space and time
results, according to him, from a mental <I>process</I> -- the "Synthesis
der Apprehension in der Anschauung." (See <A HREF="gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/02/107/7"><CITE>Critik d. reinen
Vernunft</CITE></A>. Ed. 1781, pp. 98 et seq.) My theory is merely an account
of this synthesis.

<P>
      The gist of Kant's Transcendental Aesthetic is contained in
two principles. First, that universal and necessary propositions
are not given in experience. Second, that universal and necessary
facts are determined by the conditions of experience in general.
By a universal proposition is meant merely, one which asserts
something of <I>all</I> of a sphere -- not necessarily one which all men
believe. By a necessary proposition, is meant one which asserts
what it does, not merely of the actual condition of things, but of
every possible state of things; it is not meant that the
proposition is one which we cannot help believing. Experience, in
Kant's first principle, cannot be used for a product of the
objective understanding, but must be taken for the first
impressions of sense with consciousness conjoined and worked up by
the imagination into images, together with all which is logically
deducible therefrom. In this sense, it may be admitted that
universal and necessary propositions are not given in experience.
But, in that case, neither are any inductive conclusions which
might be drawn from experience, given in it. In fact, it is the
peculiar function of induction to produce universal and necessary
propositions. Kant points out, indeed, that the universality and
necessity of scientific inductions are but the analogues of
philosophic universality and necessity; and this is true, in so
far as it is never allowable to accept a scientific conclusion
without a certain indefinite drawback. But this is owing to the
insufficiency in the number of the instances; and whenever
instances may be had in as large numbers as we please, <I>ad
infinitum</I>, a truly universal and necessary proposition is
inferable. As for Kant's second principle, that the truth of
universal and necessary propositions is dependent upon the
conditions of the general experience, it is no more nor less than
the principle of Induction. I go to a fair and draw from the
"grab-bag" twelve packages. Upon opening them, I find that every
one contains a red ball. Here is a universal fact. It depends,
then, on the condition of the experience. What is the condition of
the experience? It is solely that the balls are the contents of
packages drawn from that bag, that is, the only thing which
determined the experience, was the drawing from the bag. I infer,
then, according to the principle of Kant, that what is drawn from
the bag will contain a red ball. This is induction. Apply
induction not to any limited experience but to all human
experience and you have the Kantian philosophy, so far as it is
correctly developed.

<P>
      Kant's successors, however, have not been content with his
doctrine. Nor ought they to have been. For, there is this third
principle: "Absolutely universal propositions must be analytic."
For whatever is absolutely universal is devoid of all content or
determination, for all determination is by negation. The problem,
therefore, is not how universal propositions can be synthetical,
but how universal propositions appearing to be synthetical can be
evolved by thought alone from the purely indeterminate.
